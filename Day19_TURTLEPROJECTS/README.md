🗓️ Day 19 of #100DaysOfCode

🐢 Projects & Challenges

Today was all about interactive fun with Turtle Graphics!
I built two exciting projects:

1. Turtle Race Game — multiple turtles lined up, each with random movement, racing to the finish line. It was thrilling to see randomness in action and watch which turtle would win each time! 🏁


2. Etch-a-Sketch Game — I recreated the classic drawing game using keyboard controls.

Move the turtle with the arrow keys

Press C to clear the screen and start over

It felt like bringing a digital sketchpad to life through code! 🎨




💡 Key Concepts Learned

Handling user input and keyboard events with onkey() and listen()

Using loops and random to simulate movement and unpredictability

Managing multiple turtle objects at once

Practicing function-based code structure and reusability

✨ Reflection

Today’s projects made coding feel more playful and interactive.
It’s amazing how a few lines of logic can turn into a full-blown mini-game.
Slowly, I’m seeing how creativity and logic blend perfectly in programming! 💪
