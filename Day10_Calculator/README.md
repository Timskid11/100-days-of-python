# 🧮 Day 10 - Calculator

Today’s project marks the start of **function returning and recursion practice** — by building a working calculator 🧠

### 💡 What I Did
- Created a calculator that:
  - Takes two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  - Computes the result
  - Lets the user continue calculating with the previous answer or start fresh
- Implemented nested functions, operation dictionaries, and a loop-style logic using function calls.

### 🧰 Key Concepts
- Function parameters and return values
- Reusing functions inside other functions
- Recursion and restarting functions
- Using dictionaries to map operations to functions

### 🧩 Lessons Learned
- Nested functions can work but may cause repetition.
- Recursion can be powerful but tricky — it’s easy to create infinite restarts if not careful.
- Sometimes, “my way” is the best way to understand what the teacher’s code is really doing.

### 🚀 Next Steps
I’ll stick with my version until I fully understand how to simplify it her way.
Once I do, I’ll refactor it to look cleaner while keeping my logic strong.
