🗓️ Day 5 — Password Generator 🔐

Today was all about randomization, lists, and security — and I built something actually useful:
a Password Generator 💪

🧠 What I Learned

How to use the random module to create unpredictable results

The difference between:

random.choice() → pick a random item

random.shuffle() → rearrange items in a list


How to combine letters, numbers, and symbols to build strong passwords

How to loop through lists and join them together with "".join()


💻 What I Built

I created a Password Generator that:

Asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want

Combines them into one list

Shuffles everything to make it secure and unique

Joins the characters into one strong password string 🔒


Example output:

Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like? 6
How many symbols? 2
How many numbers? 3
Your password is: a8$Gh1!kT2m
