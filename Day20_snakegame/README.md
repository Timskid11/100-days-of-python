🐍 Day 20 of #100DaysOfCode

Today, I continued building my Snake Game using Python’s turtle module.
Here’s what I accomplished today:
✅ Created the snake body
✅ Moved the snake
✅ Added snake food

It’s been exciting watching the game start to take shape!
Tomorrow, I’ll be working on the next part:
➡️ Detecting collisions (with food, walls, and tail)
➡️ Creating a scoreboard

Every day, I’m realizing how much programming is about breaking big goals into smaller wins 💪
