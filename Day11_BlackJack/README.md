# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

A simple **Blackjack (21)** game built in Python.  
This project is part of my learning journey as I practice logic, conditionals, loops, and functions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a text-based Blackjack game where:
- You (the player) compete against the dealer.
- Each starts with 2 cards.
- You can choose to draw another card (`y`) or pass (`n`).
- Whoever gets closer to 21 without going over **wins**.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Random card dealing using Python’s `random` module  
- Score calculation for both player and dealer  
- Ace handling (counts as 11 or 1)  
- Basic game loop for replay  
- ASCII art logo for the game startup

Your cards: [10, 7], current score: 17
Computer’s first card: 9
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass:

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to **use functions** effectively in Python  
- How to **use loops** and **recursion** for game flow  
- How to **handle user input** and control the program flow  
- How to **use randomization** for realistic card draws  
- How to **add ASCII art** for better presentation  

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Save the script as `blackjack.py`
2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. Run it in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py

🚀 Future Improvements

Add a smarter dealer logic (dealer hits below 17)

Improve Ace handling

Add color output using the colorama module

Make it object-oriented (OOP version)

Create a simple UI with tkinter or pygame
