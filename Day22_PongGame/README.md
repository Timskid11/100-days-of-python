Day 22 of #100DaysOfCode â€“ The Ping Pong Game

Today was all about bringing motion, collision, and interaction together!
I built a Ping Pong (Paddle) Game using Pythonâ€™s turtle module â€” and it was honestly one of the most fun projects so far ðŸ˜„

ðŸŽ® What I Learned:

How to detect collisions between the ball and paddles or walls.

How to make the ball bounce and move dynamically across the screen.

How to manage game flow using loops and event listeners.

Improved understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts by organizing the game into multiple classes:

Ball â€“ controls movement and bouncing.

Paddle â€“ responds to user keypresses.

Scoreboard â€“ keeps track of the score.



ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

Class interaction & modular code design

Event handling (onkey() and listen())

Game loops and screen updates

Speed adjustments and rebound logic


âš¡ Next Steps:

I plan to refine the collision logic and maybe add a two-player mode or even AI-controlled paddle later.
