# Day 03: Treasure Island 🏝️

## 📖 Project Overview
Treasure Island is a simple **text-based adventure game** built with Python.  
The player makes choices at each stage, and those decisions determine whether they win or lose.

This project focuses on:
- Using **nested if/else statements**
- Handling **user input**
- Building a simple game flow with conditions

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The player is asked to choose directions and actions (left/right, swim/wait, etc.).
2. Each decision leads to a new scenario.
3. Only the right path leads to the treasure — otherwise, it’s **Game Over**!

---

## 🛠️ What I Learnt
- How to handle multiple conditions with nested `if` statements
- Importance of **input validation** (e.g., using `.lower()` to make choices case-insensitive)
- Writing interactive programs that react differently based on user input

## ▶️ Running the Game
Run the Python file:

```bash
python treasure_island.py
