🗓️ Day 18 of #100DaysOfCode

🎨 Projects & Challenges

Today was all about creativity and patience!

I explored Turtle Graphics even more deeply and worked on Damien Hirst’s spot painting project — a fun and colorful challenge that helped me understand how to use loops, random color generation, and positioning with the turtle module.

Along the way, I also revisited some smaller challenges like:

Drawing geometric shapes (squares, circles, and spirograph-style patterns)

Experimenting with the turtle.circle() function and understanding the radius, extent, and steps parameters

Practicing positioning and dot painting


💡 Key Concepts Learned

How to use RGB color tuples and colormode(255)

Using loops and random modules to generate patterns

Turtle’s dot(), penup(), and goto() for controlled placement

The beauty of combining logic and art through code


🖼️ Highlights

Created a vibrant Hirst-style painting with random color spots neatly aligned on a grid — and it actually worked! 😅

Turtle Graphics


✨ Reflection

This day reminded me that programming can be both logical and artistic. It’s satisfying to see code produce something visual and dynamic — and it’s even better when it looks like modern art!
