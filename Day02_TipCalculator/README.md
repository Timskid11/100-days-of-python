Here’s a template you can drop straight into Day02_<YourProjectName>/README.md:

# Day 02 - 100 Days of Python 🚀

**Project:** (Replace this with your project name, e.g., Working with Data Types)

---

## 📖 What I Learnt
- Different Python data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
 - Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Printing and debugging outputs
- Importance of clean syntax and indentation in Python
- The value of patience when tiny errors show up 😅

---

## 📝 Description
This project is a continuation of my 100 Days of Python challenge.  
On Day 2, I focused on understanding how Python handles numbers and data types, and practiced simple operations and outputs.  

It may look simple, but mastering the basics is a big win on the journey to writing real projects.

## ⚡ Example Code

```python
# Simple calculator example
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Addition:", num1 + num2)
print("Subtraction:", num1 - num2)
print("Multiplication:", num1 * num2)
print("Division:", num1 / num2)

🙌 Reflections

Day 1 felt like climbing a mountain just to push to GitHub.

Day 2 reminded me that sometimes, the hardest part is spotting a missing colon 😂.

Progress is progress — no matter how small.
