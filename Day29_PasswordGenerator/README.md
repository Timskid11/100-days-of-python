🐍 Day 29 – Password Generator App (Tkinter GUI)

Today, I built a Password Generator using Tkinter!
It creates strong, random passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols — and it even allows copying directly to the clipboard. 🔐

This project helped me understand GUI design, widget layouts, and randomization in Python.

Key Concepts:

Tkinter GUI basics

Random module (choice, shuffle, sample)

Clipboard functionality

Event-driven programming

> A simple app, but a big step toward building interactive tools!
