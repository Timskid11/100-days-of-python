🪓 Day 07 — Hangman

🎯 Goal

Build a complete Hangman game using what I’ve learned so far — loops, conditionals, lists, and string manipulation — while improving user experience step by step.


---

🧩 What I Learned

How to manage game states with variables (game_over, lives)

How to use while loops to keep the game running until a condition is met

How to update the display dynamically after each guess

How to import code from other files (hangman_art, hangman_words)

How to give user feedback (lives left, repeated guesses, losing messages)



---

💻 Key Features

Randomly selects a word from a list

Tracks correct and incorrect guesses

Prints the hangman ASCII art (based on lives)

Shows feedback like:

********* You lose *********
********* You have 5/6 LIVES LEFT *********



---

⚡ Improvement Focus

This day was more than just building a game — it was about improving user experience:

Making the output readable and interactive

Adding lives countdown

Warning when a letter was already guessed



---

🧠 Reflection

I’m starting to see how small parts from earlier days connect into bigger projects.
Even though I’m still reviewing some concepts from Day 5 & 6, working on Hangman helped me understand loops and logic flow better in a real project.

> “Every guess, right or wrong, is progress — both in the game and in learning.”
