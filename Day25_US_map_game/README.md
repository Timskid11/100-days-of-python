# 🗺️ Day 25: U.S. States Game

### 🎯 Project Overview
For **Day 25** of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge, I built an interactive U.S. map game using **Python**, **turtle graphics**, and **pandas**.

The goal of the game is to help users learn about the **50 states in the United States** by guessing their names and seeing them appear on the map!

---

### 🧩 Features
- Interactive U.S. map using `turtle` graphics 🐢  
- Data handling and analysis powered by `pandas` 📊  
- Reads and writes to a **CSV file** to track states guessed and those remaining  
- Simple UI that makes learning geography fun and engaging 🎓  

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **pandas** (for CSV manipulation)
- **turtle** (for game graphics)
- **CSV files** (for storing and analyzing state data)

---

### 💡 What I Learned
- How to **read and write** data from a **CSV file** using pandas  
- The real-world usefulness of **data handling libraries**  
- That **turtle graphics** only supports `.gif` format for background images  
- Improved my understanding of **data analysis** and **file I/O in Python**

### 📚 Full Meaning of CSV
> **CSV** = Comma Separated Values  
A simple file format used to store tabular data such as spreadsheets or databases.

### 🧭 Next Step
Keep pressing forward 💪 — on to **Day 26** of #100DaysOfCode!
