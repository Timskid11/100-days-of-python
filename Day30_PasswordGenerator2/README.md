🐍 Day 30 – Exception Handling & Code Improvement

After building the password generator, I took time to improve and debug my project.
I learned about exception handling in Python — making my program more reliable and user-friendly.

I added try-except blocks to handle input errors and tested how the app responds to unexpected user actions.

Key Concepts:

try, except, else, finally

Error debugging and code refactoring

Writing clean, maintainable scripts


Reflection:

> Coding isn’t just about writing — it’s about refining.
Every error teaches you something new. 💡
