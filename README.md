# 100 Days of Python ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.  
The goal is to build strong Python foundations, create projects, and grow my programming confidence step by step.

## ðŸ“… Progress
Iâ€™ll be committing each dayâ€™s work into its own folder:

- [Day 01: Band Name Generator](./Day01_BandNameGenerator)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Improve my Python coding skills  
- Share my progress publicly (GitHub + LinkedIn)  
- Stay consistent for 100 days  

Follow along and feel free to share feedback or suggestions!# 100 Days of Python Challenge
