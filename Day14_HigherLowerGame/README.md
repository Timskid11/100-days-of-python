🔼🔽 Higher or Lower: Instagram Followers Game  

A simple **Python terminal game** that tests your knowledge of who has more followers on Instagram.  
Built as my final beginner project for **Day 14 of #100DaysOfCode**. 🚀  

---

## 🎮 How It Works  

The game displays two public figures — for example:  

> Compare A: Selena Gomez  
> Against B: Miley Cyrus  

You’ll have to guess who has **more followers** by typing `A` or `B`.  
If you guess correctly, your score increases, and the game continues with a new comparison.  
If you’re wrong, the game ends and your final score is displayed.
